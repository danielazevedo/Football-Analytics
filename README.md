# Football-Analytics

In this repository I have explored some introductory concepts of football analytics using Event data and Tracking data from different sources. This includes:
- Creation of a Pitch control model
- Computing the value of a given action
- Predicting if a game action will lead to a goal or not, using Machine Learning
- Plots of different game features, like a game move, shots frame and players passing and shooting accuracy.
- Analysing the importance of features (like game stats and individual players) to the team result
- Creation of an expected goal model
